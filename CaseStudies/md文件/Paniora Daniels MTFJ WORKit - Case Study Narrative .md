# Case Study: Starting from the Ground Up - Building Digital Confidence and Connection in South Waikato

**Organisation:** MTFJ WORKit

**Contact:** Paniora Daniels, Employment Coordinator MTFJ | Community and Engagement

## Overview

MTFJ WORKit is taking its first steps into the digital space, driven by a commitment to support local people and industries to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world. Through the Mayor's Taskforce for Jobs (MTFJ), Paniora Daniels is helping the district navigate this new territory - learning from the ground up and seeking connections that can spark change.

## Experience with the Ecosystem Mapping Prototype

Paniora participated in the prototype testing to help South Waikato find its place in the regional digital landscape.

> "We need to start something here…we need to be a part of something so we don't get left behind."

For a district where digital technology is still an emerging conversation, the map offered a first glimpse of "who's who" in the sector and what resources exist.

> "If we can connect the dots, it'll be a lot clearer for us to go and portray back to other people and the community."

The tool is helping MTFJ WORKit and the community understand that 'tech' is a broad field - from infrastructure to innovation - and that participation begins with awareness.

## Key Impacts and Opportunities Identified

The ecosystem map revealed how limited connections currently are in South Waikato, with only a handful of known contacts to lean on. Paniora recognises that this visibility gap is the first challenge to address.

> "I need to know how to talk the talk…it's a different world."

At the same time, he sees immense potential for growth through partnerships and shared learning.

> "One connection could turn into 100…we're not trying to reinvent the wheel."

MTFJ WORKit aims to use the tool as both a learning platform and a connector - linking local organisations to regional opportunities and inviting others to support South Waikato's digital readiness journey.

> "Local people fixing local problems…creating pathways and tools for ourselves - that's the dream."

## Looking Ahead

MTFJ WORKit plans to leverage the Ecosystem Map to connect with industry mentors, training providers, and neighbouring districts to build a foundation for digital literacy and employment pathways. For Paniora, the goal is clear - to build confidence, capacity, and connection so that South Waikato is no longer "on the fringe," but an active part of the region's digital future.
