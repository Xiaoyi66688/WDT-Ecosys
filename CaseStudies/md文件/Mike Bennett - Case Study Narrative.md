# Case Study: Local Leadership in Digital Growth - Hamilton City Council as Customer and Connector

**Organisation:** Hamilton City Council (HCC) - Economic Development programme.

**Contact:** Mike Bennett, Economic Development Manager | Commercial & Analytics.

## Overview

Hamilton City Council is at the centre of Waikato's digital transformation, both as a major consumer of technology services and as a champion for industry growth. Through initiatives like Tech in the Tron, the Council's Economic Development Programme (EDP) works to foster innovation and attract digital investment to the region.

## Experience with the Ecosystem Mapping Prototype

Mike participated in the prototype testing because he recognised the importance of locally-led digital mapping for regional development.

> "Familiarity and respect for those organising and leading the effort, and an understanding of the important role that it can play."

He found the ecosystem map to be a uniquely valuable tool - validated and grounded in local context.

> "An organised, validated, and locally-developed tool that can help provide tangible information and measures about the sector in a way that others (TIN, etc.) can't."

The prototype demonstrated how local insight can produce more actionable data than broad national datasets, enabling Hamilton to make better, evidence-based decisions.

## Key Impacts and Opportunities Identified

The participation of the HCC EDP highlighted the dual role the Council can play as both a customer and connector.

- **As a customer,** the map can help HCC identify and engage local suppliers for technology projects, strengthening the regional economy.
- **As an economic development leader,** the Council can use its connections to enhance the dataset, attract wider participation, and promote collective ownership of the tool.

The project also revealed a common ecosystem challenge - the need for more precise sub-sector classification.

> "The difficulty in classifying or categorising sub-sectors within the ecosystem, particularly if a single company operates across many of them."

By addressing this, future iterations could deliver sharper insights into regional capability and help align investment with sector strengths.

## Quote

> "It could establish a better, clearer picture of which organisations are most active in which tech subsectors, and what challenges or opportunities exist for them."

## Looking Ahead

Hamilton City Council EDP sees ongoing potential in the Waikato Digital Technology Ecosystem Map as both a planning and procurement tool. Mike envisions leveraging the Council's networks to expand its adoption and ensure its long-term sustainability. His closing reflection captures the collaborative spirit behind the project:

> "Very ambitious project and a significant effort to create the framework and initial prototype."
